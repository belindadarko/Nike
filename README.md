Nike's Marketing Plan based on NBA Fan Engagement on Twitter

I was handed a big data set from October 2019 - October 2020 where I decided to explore over 1.1 million tweets using Text Analytics. 
I therefore decided to focus on the Allstar game & championship season, specifically looking at the months February, September & October 2020.

The case challenge is to find commentary about top teams and players mentioned in the tweets and where the marketing team should allocate spending.

Attached is the R codes and the PowerPoint from the case analysis.
